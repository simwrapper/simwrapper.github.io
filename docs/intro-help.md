This documentation is intended to get you started, but we understand that SimWrapper is a bit different from other data viz platforms and so you may have trouble getting started. And while the docs are extensive, they are never "complete" and could always be clearer...

## Example dashboards and configurations

When starting out, please look at examples of SimWrapper in action in the [SimWrapper example project](https://github.com/simwrapper/simwrapper-example-project). If you clone that repo and point SimWrapper at it, you'll see lots of examples of the various graphs and plugins available.

Then you can start modifying the configuration YAML files to experiment with settings or to add your own data.

## Asking questions and making suggestions

The best place to ask a question is the [SimWrapper discussion board(https://github.com/orgs/simwrapper/discussions) on GitHub. That way, others can also see the question and eventual responses and answers.

- Please label your questions with the label `Q&A` if you're looking for help.

## Filing bug reports / issues

We use GitHub Issues to track development, so that's the right place to file bugs for SimWrapper, too.

- File a [GitHub issue here](https://github.com/simwrapper/simwrapper/issues).
- Please label it as a `bug` thanks!

## Contributing via GitHub pull requests

We gladly accept PR's for documentation or the code itself!
